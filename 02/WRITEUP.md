# Day 2 writeup

Language used: FORTRAN

- Interesting problem, diffucult language
+ syntax was the biggest problem
- quite the adventure back to the 1950s

- Part 1 was an adventure. Instead of looking for an EOF,
    I just let the program crash when it reads too far.

Problem:
part 1: find how many strings contain 2 of a letter, and how
            many contain 3 of a letter. multiply those numbers together
part 2: find the 2 strings in input that are only off by 1 letter
