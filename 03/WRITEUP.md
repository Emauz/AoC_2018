# Day 3 writeup

Language used: javascript

TO RUN: use rhino.

+ javascript is bad when it comes to strings and integers,
    It just concatanates strings to integers and back without
    informing ir warning you.
- part one took a little while, part 2 was about 3 minutes of solving.

Problem:
    part 1: find number of overlaps between multiple rectangles on a single grid
    part 2: find the one rectangle that doesn't have an overlap
